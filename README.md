# Codes-for-Online-Judge
This repository serves as an online archiev for codes the author had worked on for multiple online judge (OJ) websites, including CodeForces, Uva, POJ, etc.. Some of these solutions have been submitted to these OJ and recieved verdict. It is not guaranteed that every code, upon submision, will recieve a verdict for "Accepted" (AC).
These codes were previously stored locally on the author's disk; however, the author feels it more important to share these codes with other individuals in order to help them either to simply provide new perspectives for solving the particular problems, or to offer a guidance for people who inspire from and aspire to achieve in various algorithm contests. The author's highest achievement so far in these competitive contests is to win the 1st tier in National Olympiad title in China. Nevertheless, the author went no further than that, and felt a bit regret not to continuing. Yet, these contests and problems still benefit the author now in providing creative aspects for analyzing, designing, and implementing the optimal solution for any problems the author met, after almost 4 years since the author won the title.
